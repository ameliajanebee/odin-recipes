    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I used Maangchi's amazing recipe to make some traditional Korean kimchi. It will take about three hours to complete this recipe, and you won't be idle! There are many vegetables to chop. But it's all worth it. Kimchi is often priced at $10 per mason jar. This recipe will make about four times as much for much less! Let's get those healthy probiotics and vitamins for less, customized the way <strong> you </strong> like it best. Feel free to add or omit any vegetables according to your taste.</p>

    <h4>Instructions (taken from 
        <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/tongbaechu-kimchi"> Maangchi's Website</a>

    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To split a cabbage in half without shredding theo split a cabbage in half without shredding the densely packed leaves inside, first cut a short slit in the base of the cabbage, enough to get a grip on either half, and then gently pull the halves apart so the cabbage splits open.</li>
        <li>Cut a slitlit through the core of each half, 2 inches above the stem. You want the cabbage leaves to be loose but still attached to the core.</li>
        <li>Dunk the halves in a large basin of water to get them wet. Sprinkle the salt between the leaves by lifting up every leaf and getting salt in there. Use more salt closer to the stems, where the leaves are thicker.</li>
        <li>Let the cabbages rest for 2 hours. Turn over every 30 minutes, so they get well salted. From time to time you can ladle some of the salty water from the bottom of the basin over top of the cabbages if you want to.</li>
        <li>After 2 hours, wash the cabbage halves a few times under cold running water. Giving them a good washing, to remove the salt and any dirt. As you wash, split the halves into quarters along the slits you cut into earlier. Cut off the cores, and put them in a strainer over a basin so they can drain well.</li>
        <li>Mix all the spices together.</li>
        <li>Spread paste on leaves of cabbage.</li>
        <li>Pack into airtight jar and let sit for several days to ferment</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Voila! You're done. Bon appetit!</h4>
